# Differential Dataflow in TypeScript

A TypeScript implementation of [differential dataflow](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/differential)

## Overview

Differential dataflow is a powerful data-parallel programming framework that enables incremental computations over changing input data. This implementation provides:

- Core differential dataflow operators (map, filter, join, reduce, etc.)
- Support for iterative computations
- Incremental updates with partially ordered versions
- Optional SQLite backend for state management and reusability

## Key Features

- **Incremental Processing**: Efficiently process changes to input data without recomputing everything
- **Rich Operators**: Supports common operations like:
  - `map()`: Transform elements
  - `filter()`: Filter elements based on predicates
  - `join()`: Join two collections
  - `reduce()`: Aggregate values by key
  - `count()`: Count elements by key
  - `distinct()`: Remove duplicates
  - `iterate()`: Perform iterative computations
- **SQLite Integration**: Optional SQLite backend for managing operator state
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript type safety and inference

## Examples

There are a number of examples in the `examples/` directory.

## Quick Start

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the structure outlined in the Materialize blog post, with some TypeScript-specific adaptations:

1. Core data structures:
   - `MultiSet`: Represents collections with multiplicities
   - `Version`: Handles partially ordered versions
   - `Antichain`: Manages frontiers
   - `Index`: Stores versioned operator state

2. Operators:
   - Base operator classes in `src/operators.ts`
   - SQLite variants in `src/operators-sqlite.ts`
   - Graph construction in `src/builder.ts`

3. Graph execution:
   - Dataflow graph management in `src/graph.ts`
   - Message passing between operators
   - Frontier tracking and advancement
